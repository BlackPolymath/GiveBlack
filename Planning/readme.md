# GiveBlack-Project2

Background and Description

GiveBlack is a grassroots-giving marketplace. Every year, those who can, give to causes and organizations they are most passionate about. Often times those organzations are widely known and heavily funded with vast donor development infrastructures.

GiveBlack is marketplace for users who wish to donate to organzations that are led by, in support of, or protect communities of color from the various harms these communities face living on the margins of society. These organzations are often severly underfudned and do not have the fundraising infastructure compared to their well-known counterparts.

GiveBlack offers users the ability to search for causes they care about, using key words(ex: healthcare, hunger, poverty) and are presented with organzations that fit their serach criteria. They can select organizations they would like to contribute (no limit) with the donation amount equally divided by the number of organizations selected.

Donors have the ability to search for, and donate to multiple causes on one platform instead of scouring the internet and going from site to site to give across causes.

Happy Giving!
